Developed an interactive puzzle game for the Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge, featuring a visually appealing layout with a custom background and styled headings. Implemented a 4x4 draggable puzzle using JavaScript, allowing users to move pieces and reassemble the image. Added real-time interaction to dynamically check puzzle piece positions and ensure accurate placement. Ensured the design is responsive and compatible across different screen sizes and devices. Enhanced user engagement and problem-solving skills through this fun, interactive game.
